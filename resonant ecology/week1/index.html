    I am a huge fan of Cosmo Sheldrake. I have been listening to his music for years, recognising the sounds of his non-human collaborators - from the birds to the fish to sounds of the water and earth. I didn’t think much about his ideologies and perspective of the nature world he indulged in his project, until I listened to his talk at the Biotopia Sense Festival about his album ‘Wake up call’. <br><br>
    
    Monica Gagliano, an ecologist known for her research on plant intelligence, believes we should give voices to other species, to the planet itself. ‘Resonant Earth' was a project that used science to support these voices, to question your knowledge and learn to listen to the non-humans, giving them a position to help guide and teach us about the world we presume to be anthropocentric. <br><br>
    
    In his talk, Cosmo believed the same. He sampled songs of endangered birds but didn’t claim all the work to himself. 50% profit of the album will be sent to charities working with that ecosystem restoration around his non-human collaborators. Cosmo wanted to learn how to recognize more than human entities in a legal framework to attribute royalties to nature, making collaborative music go beyond human way. He was giving them their voices, recognising their contributions in a human-centric world.<br><br>
    
    Animals have a lot of interesting ways to make sounds. They sing and communicate like we all do and to give them more credit is to understand what the land needs. I listened to Cosmo’s music soon after that, realising how humans can collaborate with animals, for our music and voice can be heard together.
